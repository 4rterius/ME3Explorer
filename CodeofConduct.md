# Contributor Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of this project, and in the interest of fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.

We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of, age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

New contributors are encouraged to:
* Focus on what is best for the community
* Gracefully accept constructive criticism
* Respect the experiences/viewpoints of existing members

Unacceptable behavior by participants includes, but isn't restricted to:
* The use of sexualized language, imagery, or unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Disrespectful language, trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal/political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission (doxxing)
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. 

### Enforcement
Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. The Code may be amended at any time.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by [contacting the project team](me3explorertoolset@gmail.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, and result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team will keep the reporter's identity confidential.

### Permissions
This **Contributor Code of Conduct** is adapted from v1.2 and v1.4 of the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org/).
